# Project-P-D
Project PeacefulDestruction is a Doom modding project for the GZDoom engine.
Basically like a cross between tactical-ish and a more fast paced gameplay.

## MANUAL
#### Help, I'm burning, bleeding, out of ammo, and out of meds!
Well, I've got just the thing for ya. Turn on 'Death Tips' in settings, and then just play as normal, and when you inevitably die, it'll tell you something good. Alternatively, take the boring way out and read this massive manual. (I'll try to keep it brief!)

### Getting Shot (And What to Do Afterwards)
So, you've been shot in the face by a trooper a few times, and it went through your armor. What's a young, enterprising marine to do? Have medical equipment. Here's a basic run-down.

Stimpacks. What are they even good for, anyway? They give you a small boost in health, and will act as a pretty great pain-killer. If you've been shot and don't have a Medikit, then these will keep you from stumbling around and shaking a whole bunch.

Health Potions, are those things even safe? Yes, in fact, they are. They give you a small boost of health, about 50-70% of a stim's boost, however, they also can both stop a small amount of bleeding, and numb a bit of the pain. Use these as your panic button.

Medikits. Finally, the good stuff. Sorta. They will indeed stop bleeding, and give you a rather large health boost, enough to not be knocked off by a single shot, usually. However, it takes several seconds for them to even start to do anything. The screen will flash a different color while the Medikit is in use.

Berserk. What the hell even is that? And why does it make my silent protagonist shout? Zerk will fill up your health fast, and will continue to give you strong health regeneration for most of its duration. On top of that, it boosts your mobility by a large amount, even allowing you to truly run and gun. Just don't take more than one at once thinking you'll outsmart my supreme stupidity. I'll leave that for you to learn the hard way though.

And finally, wait. You slowly regenerate health (indicated by a bright grey flash), which can save you a lot of hassle.

### Pissing Off Demons (And How to Finish the Job)
So now you're probably wondering "When can I stop sucking so much and shoot them back?" and the answer to that is now. You will learn to aim your firearm, and pull the trigger. Good for you, cadet.

#### Basic Gun Controls
Altfire - Aim (There is no hipfiring in this game!)

Reload - Take a wild guess.

Fire - Finally, shooting one of their stupid faces.

#### Guns
So now that we've got that out of the way, guns.

First of all, pistols. Typically takes 3-5 shots to kill a humanoid, depending on the gun. Lower magazine capacity - meant for a simple sidearm.

PDWs and SMGs. Might take 2-4 shots to kill a humanoid. Usually has high magazine capacity and fast rate of fire. Mind the recoil on full-auto.

Rifles. The big boys. Oftes takes 2-3 shots to dust a humanoid. They're good.

Machineguns. The obligatory Big Fucking Guns. Guaranteed 2 shots to take out a humanoid, and incredibly fast rate of fire. The recoil on these can be a bitch.

Utility weapons - launchers, the odd experimental energy weapon. Most demons will be pulverized by a rocket grenade or two. If you're lucky, you may come across a railgun - a weapon that excels in powerful long ranged attacks, but ammo for it isn't everywhere.

And let's not forget, your bare hands. Fast, deadly. Usually takes maybe 3-4 punches to knock someone out, assuming you didn't skip exercise routines in bootcamp to chit and chat with your buddies. If you're zerked up, then you can charge a punch for enough damage to knock out a Squire. Imps and Cyberdemons alike will freeze in terror in the face of your vicious attack, giving you free reign over their buttocks.

### Looting Your Pals' Corpses (And What to Do With the Goodies)
What kind of loot can I find out there? Yes, yes, you're eager to find something fancy and expensive. So, goodies. There's more than the simple medical equipment we've already covered. You know, the Tacticool stuff. NVGs, hazmat suits, body armor. Or armour if you're from literally anywhere other than the United States. Enough chit chat, let's get to it.

#### Armors
Ah, yes. Finally, you won't keel over and die when a fly so much as farts on you. There are three types - Light Armor, Heavy Armor, and Blast Armor. They are self explanatory. Heavy Armor is somewhat more fragile, but absorbs more in total, Blast Armor is weak against bullets but can easily save you from an explosion or two, etc. Note: don't expect that puny armor of yours to stop you from being turned to paste by a direct rocket hit. Even blast armor can't save you if you're too close to the blast, nor will it stop you from being flung into something else that wants you dead.

#### General Tactical Tools
General goodies that do general stuffs. They each have a purpose. Some are less valuable or useful than others.

Night Vision Visor/Light Amplification Visor. You know what this does. Typical green overlay that's sorta useful at best. It does work, but it needs some light to function.

Hazardous Environment Protection Suit. It protects one hell of a lot against fire, electricity, etc. Just don't expect it to stop a Knave tracer or a Noblefolk's fireball.

### Enemy Varieties (And How Not to Get Steamrolled By Them)
If you plan on actually playing the game, you may come across a few of these. This section will cover broader categories of demons.

#### Humans and Once-Humans
Enemies like your average Zombieman or Trooper are slightly smarter than your standard demonoid. They may wait for you around corners or try to ambush you, and their firearms can easily be your death. If you're unfortunate enough, you'll come across an ex-marine traitor, who was once either a UAAF marine like yourself or an AGM contractor. They're fast and deadly, and wield assault rifles. If you're unlucky enough to come across one running a FAMAS, then say goodbye to your heartbeat. They're armored, agile, and a bit more intelligent than a regular zombie.

#### Melee Demons
If you have the misfortune of coming across one of these, you'll be happy to know that most of them have some form of charging toward you, during which they'll be wide open to a bit of friendly convincing to stop (See: Guns), but barring that there's always room for a bit of good ol' fashioned boxing. If you find a leaping Grunt or charging Lost Soul, you can always counterpunch them like it's '87 again.

#### Fireball Flingers
Unfortunately for you and the once pristine paint on these walls, some demons can toss fireballs. Imps' projectiles can be shot at, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for Noblefolk. Barons and Marquesses get fireballs that can slightly home in on you, so stay alert. If you find yourself on fire, crouch and fling your mouse around. Or don't, but it'll hurt a lot before the fire goes out.

#### Utility-Using Demons
These are demonoids that make use of body-mounted weaponry or similar. Mancubi can be the least of your worries on this list, as included here are Bolt Spiders, Arachnotrons, the ever dreaded Knave with its homing missiles, and even Spiderdemons and Cyberdemons. Thankfully, however, none of these have...

#### Nightmare Variants
If you're insane enough to play the game on Nightmare skill level, you will come across purple-hued Nightmare Demons. Nightmare Grunts are much faster and perfectly capable of two shotting you, Nightmare Cacodemons will end you in a heartbeat, and Nightmare Imps will take a lot more punishment than standard ones. Standard Pain-Elementals have been known to rarely spit out Nightmare Lost Souls.
