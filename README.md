# Project-P-D
Project PeacefulDestruction is a Doom modding project for the GZDoom engine.
Basically like a cross between Hideous Destructor and generic runnin' 'n' gunnin', when you break it down, but with a bit of random stuff to spice it up.

## MANUAL
#### Help, I'm burning, bleeding, out of ammo, and out of meds!
Well, I've got just the thing for ya. Turn on 'Death Tips' in settings, and then just play as normal, and when you inevitably die, it'll tell you something good. Alternatively, take the boring way out and read this massive manual. (I'll try to keep it brief!)

### Getting Shot (And What to Do Afterwards)
So, you've been shot in the face by a trooper a few times, and it went through your armor. What's a young, enterprising marine to do? Have medical equipment. Here's a basic run-down.

Stimpacks. What are they even good for, anyway? They give you a small boost in health, and will act as a pretty great pain-killer. If you've been shot and don't have a Medikit, then these will keep you from stumbling around and shaking a whole bunch.

Health Potions, are those things even safe? Yes, in fact, they are. They give you a small boost of health, about 50-70% of a stim's boost, however, they also can both stop a small amount of bleeding, and numb a bit of the pain. Use these as your panic button.

Medikits. Finally, the good stuff. Sorta. They will indeed stop bleeding, and give you a rather large health boost, enough to not be knocked off by a single shot, usually. However, it takes several seconds for them to even start to do anything. The screen will flash a different color while the Medikit is in use.

Berserk. What the hell even is that? And why does it make my silent protagonist shout? Zerk will fill up your health fast, and will continue to give you strong health regeneration for most of its duration. On top of that, it boosts your mobility by a large amount, even allowing you to truly run and gun. Just don't take more than one at once thinking you'll outsmart my supreme stupidity. I'll leave that for you to learn the hard way though.

And finally, wait. You slowly regenerate health (indicated by a bright looking flash), which can save you a lot of hassle.

### Pissing Off Demons (And How to Finish the Job)
So now you're probably wondering "When can I stop sucking so much and shoot them back?" and the answer to that is now. You will learn to aim your firearm, and pull the trigger. Good for you, cadet.

#### Basic Gun Controls
Altfire - Aim (There is no hipfiring in this game!)

Reload - Take a wild guess.

Fire - Finally, shooting one of their stupid faces.

#### Guns
So now that we've got that out of the way, guns.

First of all, pistols. Typically takes 3-5 shots to kill a humanoid, depending on the gun. Lower magazine capacity - meant for a simply sidearm.

PDWs and SMGs. Might take 2-4 shots to kill a humanoid. Usually has high magazine capacity and fast rate of fire. Mind the recoil on full-auto.

Rifles. The big boys. Oftes takes 2-3 shots to dust a humanoid. They're good.

Machineguns. The obligatory Big Fucking Guns. Guaranteed 2 shots to take out a humanoid, and incredibly fast rate of fire. The recoil on these can be a bitch.

### Looting Your Pals' Corpses (And What to Do With the Goodies)
What kind of loot can I find out there? Yes, yes, I know the whole spiel already. Please, save it for the others. Because I might just shoot you instead. So, goodies. There's more than the simple medical equipment we've already covered. You know, the Tacticool stuff. NVGs, hazmat suits, body armor. Or armour if you're from literally anywhere other than the United States. Enough chit chat, let's get to it.

#### Armors
Ah, yes. Finally, you won't keel over and die when a fly so much as farts on you. There are three types - Light Armor, Heavy Armor, and Blast Armor. They are self explanatory. Heavy Armor is somewhat more fragile, but absorbs more in total, Blast Armor is weak against bullets but can easily save you from an explosion or two, etc.

#### General Tactical Tools
General goodies that do general stuffs. They each have a purpose. Some are less valuable or useful than others.

Night Vision Visor/Light Amplification Visor. You know what this does. Typical green overlay that's barely useful. It does somewhat work, but it needs some light to function.

Hazardous Environment Protection Suit. It protects one hell of a lot against fire, electricity, etc. Just don't expect it to stop a Knave tracer or a Noblefolk's fireball.
